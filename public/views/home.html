    <p id="inspiration">  Writing down your dreams, goals, and business ideas helps you brainstorm on a more ambitious scale.

  Thereâ€™s nothing quite like writing down a startup idea in the middle of a blank page and then branching out with a flurry of ideas.

  Plus, writing down your thoughts gives you a chance to explore dreams that you may not wish to share with others. It also affords you a physical space to keep track of those thoughts, and return to them later if needed. </p>
